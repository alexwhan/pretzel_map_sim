# Genetic map and population/genotype simulation

These simulations are made for generating test data for [pretzel](https://github.com/plantinformatics/pretzel) development.

They depend on [R/qtl](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl). I have used a subset of markers from the 90k consensus map ordered more or less in the correct way so that comparisons can be made with real maps.
